                    It helps you write applications
                    that behave consistently, run in
                    different environments (client,
                    server, and native), and are easy
                    to test. On top of that, it
                    provides a great developer
                    experience, such as live code
                    editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

                    The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
                    The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object
                    describing what happened. To specify how the actions transform the state tree, 
                    you write pure reducers.
